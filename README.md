[B18] Backup Generators
--------------------------------
Backup generators provide a stopgap to prevent black/brownouts when battery reserves are depleted.

Get them on the [Steam Workshop](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=899559174).

Features
--------------------------------
* Generators start producing power when connected reserves are critically low (&lt;= 200 Wd) and stop when reserves exceed 1000 Wd or their power is flicked off/on
* Brand new art! Uranium version! Thanks, Xsile!
* Configurable low and high reserve values in mod settings. Thanks, Herbiems89!
